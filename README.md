2. Install the font:
   - Open the downloaded `.ttf` file and click the **Install** button.

## 2. Install Plugins and Configure .zshrc
Once Zsh is set up as your shell, run the following command to install the necessary plugins and configure your .zshrc file:

```bash

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SofiDevO/sofi-zsh/main/sofi-zsh-config.sh | sudo bash
```

## What does this script do?

- Configures the **Powerlevel10k** theme.
- Installs popular plugins:
  - `zsh-autosuggestions`
  - `zsh-syntax-highlighting`
  - `fast-syntax-highlighting`
  - `zsh-autocomplete`
- Configure your .zshrc file with the recommended settings.
- If you already have a .zshrc file, a backup will be created before it is overwritten with the new configuration.

What to do next?
Once the second script finishes running, restart your terminal or run zsh to see the changes. You can adjust the theme and plugin settings by editing the .zshrc file in your home directory (~/.zshrc).
